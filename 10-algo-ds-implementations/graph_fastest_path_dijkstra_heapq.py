    Dijkstra's Algorithm
    Input: Weighted Graph: G(V, E, W), s âˆˆ V
        - Undirected or Directed
        - We >= 0 for all e in E

    Output: 
        - fastest path from s to any v in V
        - fastest path distances from s to any v in V
    
    Time and Space Complexity:
        - Time Complexity: O(|V| + |E|log|E|)
            - T(Initialization) + T(Compute Min Distance) = O(|V|) + P(|E|*log|E|)
            - Dense graph (|E| = O(|V|^2)) --> T = O(|V| + |V|^2 * log|V|^2) = O(|V|^2 * log|V|)
            - Sparce graph (|E| ~ |V|)     --> T = O(|V| + |V|log|V|) = O(|V|log|V|) 
        - Space Complexity: O(|V| + |E|)
            - S(Parent list) + S(distance list) + S(Heap queue) = O(|V| + |V| + |E|) = O(|V| + |E|)
    
    Implementation Assumptions:
        - Directed graph
        - Edges number starts from 0 (zero-based numbering)
        - Edges list is valid
            - 0 <= edge.source, edge.sink < vertices_count for any edge in edges list
            - It does not have duplicates
